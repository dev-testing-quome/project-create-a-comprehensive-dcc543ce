# project-create-a-comprehensive Architecture

## System Overview
Create a comprehensive government permit management system that enables citizens and businesses to apply for permits online with streamlined approval workflows. The platform should allow applicants to submit permit applications with secure document uploads, track application status in real-time with automated notifications, support government staff with review and approval workflows, process permit fees with secure payment integration, manage permit renewals and expiration tracking, provide public access to permit status and inspection records, generate regulatory reports and analytics for government agencies, support multi-departmental review processes with routing and coordination, maintain comprehensive audit trails for all permit activities, and ensure compliance with public records laws and government transparency requirements.
